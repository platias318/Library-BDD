This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis for completing my studies at AUEB, and is about providing the requirements of an application to a Large Language Model ,like Chat gpt in our case, with a semi-structured language like Gherkin( which is a big part in projects being built with BDD practises), and executing an experiment by providing more and more information in different stages, while also reviewing the results the Ai provides. This way, we might be able to understand better the way these Models work, and try and create an automated process and steps for a software developer/tester to follow in order for him to get better results. The stages we provide the information are 4 : At the start, we provide only the architecture and the features of these Gherking scenarios of the application, then in second phase we also provide the name of the domain classes, then in the third phase we provide as an extra the attributes of the domain classes and in the last phase we provide also the name of the methods for these domain classes(with all the information of the previous phases as well).
